I have successfully completed this task using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. This project allows users to browse products, apply filters to find their desired items, and make purchases. For seamless navigation, I implemented React Router to manage pages like Home, Categories, and Contact.

To ensure type safety and prevent future errors, I used TypeScript, applying strong typing to all variables and functions for better developer experience. Additionally, I integrated the AOS animation library to enhance user interaction and ensure smooth animations. The project is fully responsive across all devices.
